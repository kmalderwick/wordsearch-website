## üîë About Prof. Alderwick

Professor Alderwick is a mild-mannered scholar of words, keys, and hidden mysteries. He lives in an old, slightly crumbling home filled with dusty books, creaky floorboards, and the comforting presence of his beloved chocolate labrador named **Zephyr**, who enjoys snoozing in sunbeams.

When he‚Äôs not crafting **challenging word search puzzles**, you‚Äôll find him wandering his overgrown garden, sipping cups of oolong tea, or gazing through his battered telescope at distant constellations.

Professor Alderwick believes that curiosity is a superpower ‚Äî and that every puzzle solved is a tiny victory. He makes friends easily with old books, lost maps, and the occasional clever stranger who finds their way to his cozy corner of the world.
